# crystalpass
 Pokemon Crystal password calculator made with Haskell.
# What does this do?
 Run this program `crystalpass path/to/your/savefile.sav` to generate a password for Pokemon Crystal.
 You can use that password to reset the in-game clock. Read more here: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Time#Generation_II
# Why did I make this?
 I did this in an afternoon for a couple of reasons.
 1. I wanted to write some Haskell after a couple of years away from it.
 2. My friend is a big Pokemon fan, and he told me about this game's password system. It sounded neat.
 3. I haven't worked with binary files in a long time.
# How can I build and install this?
 You'll need to [install Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) if you don't have it already.
 Then, clone this repo and run `stack install`. I doubt that I'll ever put this on hackage.
